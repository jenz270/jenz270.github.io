## Home Cooking
Happy new year to you who are reading this blog post! One of my biggest goals this year is to cook at home more. I hope through doing this I will be able to expand the number of dishes that I am able to cook! I am always open to more suggestions on what I should try to make at home so post them in the comments below!

## Pasta Making
I learned how to make pasta starting from the end of the year last year and had been addicted to fresh pasta ever since! They taste so much better and it's so therapeutic to make! Here are some of the picture of my parents and I making them together:

That's it for now! As usual feel free to follow my photography instagram [@logmylens](https://www.instagram.com/logmylens/) for more beautiful content!
