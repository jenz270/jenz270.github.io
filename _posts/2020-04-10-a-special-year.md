## What's happening right now...
When the COVID-19 first started spreading in China, I had fears of it coming to Canada. Unfortunately, the virus was 
inevitable and has now evolved into a global pandemic. Although I am completely with fine with staying at home for the 
time being, it definitely had an impact on my vision for the year 2020. 

## 2020 plans
Originally, I wanted to I explore further into street photography. I've always had an interest towards freezing the moment
by taking a shot of people's natural expressions. I hope that once this is all over, I will be able to pick up my camera
again to shoot whatever I'd like! 

Something that is exciting this year is that I've decided to officially pursue a career in Android Development! TD had given
me a unique opportunity to explore different fields and after about 9 months with the Android team, I've officially fallen
in love with app development!

With the time that I've saved from commuting, I can now work on my projects in peace. Since I am still new to the Android 
Development Scene, I will take this time to gain as much knowledge as possible. I would also like to build apps that
I enjoy building along the way. 

I hope that after this pandemic is over, I am able to continue doing what I enjoy, both work and photography!

Stay safe and self-isolate!
