## A new beginning

Welcome to my new personal landing page! 
This is my very first blog post on a brand new site after a 2 year hiatus! 
A lot has changed over the years as I've achieved multiple different milestones.
I've finished my final year of university and started my job at TD Canada.

It feels amazing to be able to write again! I would love to share my experiences and thoughts
on new technologies, fun adventures over the year, and more things that I am
passionate about here on this blog.

I would like to use this blog as a place where I am able to monitor my own growth, whether
it is in life or career wise. It may be interesting to look back at this a few years later and 
reflect on everything that I've done!

Cheers! 
Jieni :)
