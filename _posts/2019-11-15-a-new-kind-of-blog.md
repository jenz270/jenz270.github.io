## A new beginning

Welcome to my new personal landing page! 
This is my very first blog post on my brand new site after a 2 year hiatus! 
A lot has changed over the years as I've achieved multiple different milestones.
I've finished my final year of university and started my job at TD Canada.

It feels amazing to be able to write again, sharing my experiences and thoughts
on new technologies, fun adventures over the year, and more things that I am
passionate about that I would love to discuss.

I hope to use this blog as a place where I am able to see my own growth, whether
it is in life, or career wise.

Cheers!
