## Fall Season 
This fall season had been the first time that I had been taking way more photos than usual as I finally got a DSLR this year.
Although not the most professional camera (Nikon D3500), it had been an amazing camera for me to learn how to shoot on a DSLR!
Here are some of the shots I've taken over the past fall season:

![Fall 1](/assets/photos/fall-1.JPG "Dundas Peak")
![Fall 1](/assets/photos/fall-4.JPG "Fruit")

That's it for now! Feel free to follow my photography instagram [@logmylens](https://www.instagram.com/logmylens/) for more shots that I've taken!  

Cheers!
